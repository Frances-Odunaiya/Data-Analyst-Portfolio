## Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Kaggle 30 Days of ML

**Description:** 30 days of Machine Learning by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml). The course rapidly covers the most essential skills needed to get hands dirty with data and quickly learn how to build machine learning models.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/frances-odunaiya/kaggle_30_Days_of_ML)  
**Status:** in Progress

### Tableau Vizzes

## Certificates

I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):

- [Introduction to Linux](https://stepik.org/cert/4441) (Dec 2014) (Stepik - Bioinformatics Institute)
- [IELTS Academic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bB3bBUtCeHttCQQHdLP6Om45dFgDyXYw/view?usp=sharing) (Overall Band Score 7.0 - Proficient English User (C1)) (Apr 2014)
