# Frances Odunaiya - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Frances! I have a technical professional background and hold a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) degree in Microbiology from Lagos State University, an Advanced Diploma in Business Management from University of Lagos, and a Corporate & Continuing Education Certificate in Business Intelligence and Analytics from Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. I have over 5 years of technical experience, where I held roles such as Software Engineer - Process Automation Unit, and Front Line Technical Support Officer in a Financial Institution, Customer Insight Analyst at a beauty company in Canada. After a year of transitioning from Software Development to Data Analysis, I am currently a Canada Digital Adoption Program Ecommerce Advisor and Analyst at Mosaic North America, starting from January 2024.

This is the Main Page for all exploration of Data. It is designed to help with with navigation to the main project folders.

## Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel

**Description:** Microsoft Excel is a powerful spreadsheet software widely used for data analysis, calculation, and visualization. It offers a user-friendly interface with versatile functions for managing numerical data. Excel is a fundamental tool for businesses, academics, and individuals for creating tables, charts, and complex calculations.
**Repository:** Check the repository having Excel Spreadsheets and some PDF files to back up with the problems/ tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Excel.git) 

### Data Visualizations Using POWER BI
**Description:** Power BI is a Microsoft business analytics tool for creating interactive reports and dashboards. Users can connect to diverse data sources, transform data, and build visualizations. The cloud-based Power BI Service allows sharing and collaboration on reports. Power BI Mobile offers on-the-go access to reports on iOS and Android devices. With features like Power Query and DAX, Power BI is a comprehensive solution for data analysis and visualization.
**Repository:** Check the repository that contains all the Data, Problems which can be seen in the PDF/Doc.x files and PowerBi reporting Dashboards containing all visuals gotten from insights. ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Visualizations-using-POWER-BI.git)

### Data Analysis and Visualization utilizing Python
**Description:** Data analysis and visualization using Python involves leveraging Python programming language and its libraries to analyze datasets and present insights visually. Python offers powerful tools such as pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computing, and libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating various types of visualizations, including plots, charts, and graphs. By combining data analysis techniques with visualization capabilities, Python enables users to explore, understand, and communicate complex data patterns effectively.
**Repository:** Check the repository that aims to showcase various data analysis and visualization projects implemented using Python. ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-utilizing-Python.git)

### Data Analysis and Visualizations Using SQL POWERBI
**Description:** SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to query, manipulate, and analyze data stored in relational databases. I am utilizing SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from the database.
I will be leveraging SQL for data analysis tasks and Power BI for visualization. Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool by Microsoft that allows users to visualize and share insights from their data. I am using Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards that showcase the insights derived from SQL analysis.
**Repository:** Check the repository that aims to provide insights into various datasets through SQL queries and then visualize these insights in an interactive dashboard format using Power BI.. ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Analysis-and-Visualizations-Using-SQL-POWERBI.git)

### Kaggle machine learning

**Description:** 30 days of Machine Learning by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning). The course rapidly covers the most essential skills needed to get hands dirty with data and quickly learn how to build machine learning models.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/intro_to_machine_learning.git)  
**Status:** in Progress

### Tableau Vizzes

**Description:** My Tableau Public account ---> [go to Tableau..](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/frances.odunaiya/)  

**Status:** ∞

### Kaggle Vizzes

**Description:** My Kaggle Public account ---> [go to Kaggle..](https://www.kaggle.com/rollyf/)

**Status:** ∞
